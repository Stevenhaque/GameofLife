# CPP Game Of Life with raylib

This is a C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life using raylib for graphics. The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from human players. Players set up the initial configuration of cells on a grid, and then watch as generations evolve over time.

The project aims to provide an interactive experience, allowing users to visually explore the behavior of cellular automata through various patterns and configurations. Whether you're a seasoned programmer looking to experiment with raylib and cellular automata, or a beginner curious about the fascinating world of emergent complexity from simple rules, this tutorial offers something for everyone.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to toggle cells between alive and dead states, crafting your initial setup or modifying it on the fly.
- **Control Simulation Flow**: Easily start, pause, or reset your simulation with keyboard shortcuts.
- **Dynamic Speed Adjustment**: Use keyboard inputs to speed up or slow down the evolution of the generations.
- **Random Initialization**: Generate a random starting point to explore unexpected patterns and behaviors.
- **Infinite Grid**: Thanks to edge wrapping, experience an unbounded canvas for your cellular automata, allowing patterns to move seamlessly across the grid boundaries.
